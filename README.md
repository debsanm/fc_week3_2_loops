# fc_week3_2 assignments: Loop

1. A country club, which currently charges $3,000 per year for membership, has announced it will increase its membership fee by 3 percent each year for the next five years. Write a program that uses a loop to display the projected rates for each of the next five years.


2.  Write a program with a loop that lets the user enter a series of integers, followed by the end sentinel −99 to signal the end of the series. After all the numbers have been entered, the program should display the largest and smallest numbers entered.

3. Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user’s guess is higher than the random number, the program should display “Too high. Try again.” If the user’s guess is lower than the random number, the program should display “Too low. Try again.” The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number. Then the program should display “Congratulations. You figured out my number.”

4. Enhance the program that you wrote for the Programming Challenge 3 so it keeps a count of the number of guesses the user makes. When the user correctly guesses the random number, the program should display the number of guesses along with the message of congratulations.
